# Demands

Demands is a restaurant manager build with Angular 9. Your function is to control some operations that happen in a restaurant such as organize the restaurant tables and manager the orders

The manager area is very simple, and contains informations about:
* Users 
* Products
* Products' Ingredients
* Products' Categories
* Tables
* Reports

The project is in progress end besides Angular, uses .Net Core in backend. This is the first project using Angular that I'm publish since the Angular Js and has been very good back to work with this incrididable tool. 

my bigger target with this project is learn more about this nice framework and at the same time, share with the community, the possibilities of use it.

Soon, I'll update this doc with the API built with .Net core.
